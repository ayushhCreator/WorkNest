## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (see Database Setup section below)
- npm or yarn
- Cloudinary account (for file uploads)
- SMTP email service (for notifications)

### Database Setup

**Important**: This application requires a MongoDB database. You have several options:

#### Option 1: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended for Development)
1. Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster (free tier available)
3. Create a database user with read/write permissions
4. Get your connection string from the "Connect" button
5. Replace the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file with your Atlas connection string

#### Option 2: Local MongoDB Installation
1. Download and install MongoDB Community Server from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Start MongoDB service:
   - **Windows**: MongoDB should start automatically as a service
   - **macOS**: Run `brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community` (if installed via Homebrew)
   - **Linux**: Run `sudo systemctl start mongod`
3. Verify MongoDB is running by connecting to `mongodb://localhost:27017`

#### Option 3: Docker MongoDB
```bash
# Run MongoDB in a Docker container
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd worknest
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install client dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create an environment file in the server directory and the below env code.

   ```env
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   
   # Database
   # For MongoDB Atlas (replace with your connection string):
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/worknest?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   # For local MongoDB:
   # MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/worknest
   
   # JWT Secret Key
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-change-in-production
   
   # Client URL
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   
   # Email Configuration (for invitations and reminders)
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
   SMTP_FROM=WorkNest <noreply@worknest.com>
   
   # Cloudinary Configuration (for file uploads)
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```

4. **Third-Party Service Setup**

   **Email Service (Required for invitations):**
   - For Gmail: Enable 2FA and create an App Password
   - For other providers: Configure SMTP settings accordingly
   
   **Cloudinary (Required for file uploads):**
   - Create account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
   - Get your cloud name, API key, and API secret from dashboard
   - Add credentials to `.env` file

5. **Start MongoDB** (if using local installation)
   ```bash
   # Check if MongoDB is running:
   mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ismaster')"
   ```

6. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   # Start the backend server (from server directory)
   cd server
   npm run dev
   
   # Start the frontend server (from root directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## üîß Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues

If you encounter `MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017`:

1. **Verify MongoDB is running**:
   ```bash
   # Check if MongoDB process is running
   ps aux | grep mongod
   
   # Or try connecting directly
   mongosh
   ```

2. **Start MongoDB service**:
   - **Windows**: Check Windows Services for MongoDB
   - **macOS**: `brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community`
   - **Linux**: `sudo systemctl start mongod`

3. **Check MongoDB logs**:
   - **Windows**: Check Event Viewer or MongoDB log files
   - **macOS/Linux**: `tail -f /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log`

4. **Alternative**: Use MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted database (recommended for development)

### Email Configuration Issues
- Ensure SMTP credentials are correct
- For Gmail, use App Passwords instead of regular password
- Check firewall settings for SMTP ports

### File Upload Issues
- Verify Cloudinary credentials
- Check file size limits (default: 10MB)
- Ensure proper file types are being uploaded

### Common Solutions
- Ensure your `.env` file has the correct `MONGODB_URI`
- Check firewall settings if using remote MongoDB
- Verify MongoDB is listening on the correct port (default: 27017)
- For Atlas: Ensure your IP address is whitelisted in Network Access
